        A common pattern in handling HTTP requests in Node.js is to have a

        request. These chunks are aggregated into a body variable.

        When the req.on('end') event is emitted, it signifies that all data from
        the request has been received. Typically, this data is in the form of a
        string. To work with this data in a structured format, it is often parsed
        into a JSON object using JSON.parse(body), provided the data is in JSON
        format.

        Our nodes expect data in JSON format.
